# Matt Woodruff

The perfect blend of soft and technical skills.

## About this Portfolio

This portfolio was made to showcase my experience as a Software Engineer, and to showcase several technologies I really enjoy using! They are:

* TypeScript

* React

* Tailwind CSS

This app also links you to my LinkedIn, GitHub, and Resume. You can view the live site at [mattjwoodruff.com](https://mattjwoodruff.com/) to see the final product.

## What's Next?

I plan on continuing to add to this app! Anything fun or quirky I feel like would show off my skills or personality will be added as I go.

Thank you for taking a moment to check out this repo! You can always message me on LinkedIn or email me if you would like to learn more, or have a proposition to work together!
